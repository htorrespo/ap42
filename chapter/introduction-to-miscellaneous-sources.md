This chapter contains emission factor information on those source categories that differ substantially from, and hence cannot be grouped with, the other "stationary" sources discussed in this publication. Most of these miscellaneous emitters, both natural and manmade, are truly area sources, with their pollutant-generating process(es) dispersed over large land areas.   Another characteristic of these sources is the inapplicability, in most cases, of conventional control methods such as wet/dry equipment, fuel switching, process changes, etc. Instead, control of these emissions, where possible at all, may involve such techniques as modification of agricultural burning practices, paving with asphalt or concrete, or stabilization of dirt roads. Finally, miscellaneous sources generally emit pollutants intermittently, compared to most stationary point sources. For example, a wildfire may emit large quantities of particulate and carbon monoxide for several hours or even days. But, when measured against a continuous emitter over a long period of time its emissions may seem relatively minor. Also, effects on air quality may be of relatively short duration.

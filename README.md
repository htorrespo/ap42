## Heavy Construction Operations

Heavy construction is a source of dust emissions that may have substantial temporary impact on local air quality. Building and road construction are 2 examples of construction activities with high emissions potential. Emissions during the construction of a building or road can be associated with land clearing, drilling and blasting, ground excavation, cut and fill operations (i.e., earth moving), and construction of a particular facility itself. Dust emissions often vary substantially from day to day, depending on the level of activity, the specific operations, and the prevailing meteorological conditions.   A large portion of the emissions results from equipment traffic over temporary roads at the construction site.

The temporary nature of construction differentiates it from other fugitive dust sources as to estimation and control of emissions. Construction consists of a series of different operations, each with its own duration and potential for dust generation.   In other words, emissions from any single construction site can be expected (1) to have a definable beginning and an end and (2) to vary substantially over different phases of the construction process. This is in contrast to most other fugitive dust sources, where emissions are either relatively steady or follow a discernable annual cycle. Furthermore, there is often a need to estimate areawide construction emissions, without regard to the actual plans of any individual construction project. For these reasons, following are methods by which either areawide or site-specific emissions may be estimated.

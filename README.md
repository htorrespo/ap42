Estimación de la emisión de contaminantes 

##Heavy Construction Operations
Heavy construction is a source of dust emissions that may have substantial temporary impact
on local air quality.   Building and road construction are 2 examples of construction activities with high
emissions potential.   Emissions during the construction of a building or road can be associated with
land clearing, drilling and blasting, ground excavation, cut and fill operations (i.e., earth moving), and
construction of a particular facility itself.   Dust emissions often vary substantially from day to day,
depending on the level of activity, the specific operations, and the prevailing meteorological
conditions.   A large portion of the emissions results from equipment traffic over temporary roads at
the construction site.
